# Introduction
Motivation: User should decide on interpretability  / accuracy tradeoff

# Review
Multicrit often looks at complexity: Examples
But nowhere are explicit, model-agnostic interpretability measures used


# Prerequisites
little bit about multicrit


# Interpretability measures
Discuss pros and cons, show examples. 

## Sobol interaction strength

## Degrees of freedom univariate


## Others

- R squared for linear PDP approx
- Feature Importance Gini?
- 



# The Optimization problem
Mathematically writing down objectives

as alternative: pareto front per learner and later combine or do something else

# Experiment

## within xgboost

## across learners


## recreating accuracy interpretability figure
