\subsection{Number of Features}
\label{sec:interaction}

Desiderata was model-agnostic measures.

Many models always use all features.
e.g. linear model always uses all features.

For other models we have easy ways to extract it:
For tree we can extract the features used in the splits
for sparse linear model the weights that are non-zero.

For ensembles and pipelines it is more complex.
e.g. stacking of multiple sparse models. in theory have to go through all models and see what features were used and take  union.

Also we might not have access to the model itself, only via API.
Then we can't extract the model-specific number of features.


We propose a heuristic approach to determine how many features were used, which is based on permutation of features.
Has a bit similarity to feature importance.

Take sample from data, measure predictions.
to see whether feature $x_j$ was used for the predictions, shuffle feature $x_j$ in the sample and get predictions from model.
If prediction was changed, the feature is used and we count it to the number of features used in the model.

We repeat a couple of times to reduce false negative rate.
False positive rate is zero, because when method says that feature is used, then it is used for sure in model (assuming that the model is deterministic).



We draw M instances from the data and for each randomly draw K permutations.

The algorithm for computing if feature j was used:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set number of sampled instance M and number of shuffle K, dataset d
\item for $i=1,\ldots, M$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw M instances from dataset D
\item Change for each instance the value of feature $x_j$ by randomly sampled value from dist: New instances is $x^*$
\item Compute $\hat{f}(x^{(i)*}) - \hat{f}(x^{(i)})$ for each instance i
\item If any difference bigger than zero return TRUE
\end{enumerate}
\item If all difference were zero, return false
\end{enumerate}



Let $z_j$ indicate whether at least one maninpulation of feature j would lead to a change in prediction:

$$ z_j = \begin{cases}1 & \exists x, d \Rightarrow \hat{f}(x) - \hat{f}(x + d_j) \neq 0 \\0 & else\\\end{cases}$$

where $d_j$ is a vector with zeroes that's only different from zero for feauture j.

Let $\hat{z}_j$be our guess of $z_j$.

We know that the false positive rate is zero for deterministic prediction functions:

$$\mathbb{P}(\hat{z}_j = 1 | z_j = 0) = 0$$

false negative rate depends on the model and data distribution.

We have the following:

Let $p_j$ be the probability that for a randomly sampled instance from the data  we can find a change in feature $x_j$ that would lead to a change in the prediction.
For linear models, this is always 1.
Only in case of interactions will this value be less than zero.

Let $r_{j}^{(i)}$ be the probability that for a given feature $x_j$ and an instance i for which we can find a value to change the prediction, that by randomly choosing a value (according to the marginal distribution of the feature) the prediction will not change.
For linear models this probability is zero, because even the slightest change in a feature value will lead to a change in prediction.
For a feature in a decision tree, with a split at the median of feature values $x_j$, the probability $r_j^{(i)}$ is 0.5, because we have a 50\% change to sample a feature value from the same interval.
For a categorical feature with two categories it's the probability of staying within the same category, which is the same as the frequency of that category.


Then the probability of false negative is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(\hat{z}_j = 0 | z_j = 1) &= \prod_{m=1}^M \left(\underbrace{1-p_j}_{\text{instance unchangeable by j}}  + \underbrace{p_j  \prod_{k=1}^K r_j^{(i)}}_{repeatedly unlucky} \right) \\
&\underbrace{=}_{r_{j}^{(i)} = r_j} \left(1 - p_j + p_j (r_j)^K\right)^M
\end{eqnarray*}


A few examples:

M always 100, K always 10.

Linear model without interactions: $p_j=1$ and $r_j^{(i)} = r_j = 0$
$$\mathbb{P}(\hat{z}_j = 0| z_j = 1) = (1 - 1 + 0^10)^100 = 0$$

Let's say only 1 percent of instances is affected by a change in a feature, and for those the probability that a change in the feature wil change the prediction is also 2 percent.
E.g. only features with a certain category level are affected, which only 1 percent of instances have.
There is an interaction effect with a second categorical feature, but only when a certain level combination comes, which has a probability of 2 percent to happen.
If $p_j=0.01$ and $r_j=0.02$, then

$$\mathbb{P}(\hat{z}_j = 0| z_j = 1) = (0.99 + 0.01 * 0.01^10)^100 = 0.3660323$$

IN this case limited by number of instances sampled.
If we increase to 500, the probability drops to  0.006570483.
