Thoughts:

- Create the interpretability vs accuracy figure
- #Optimizing for interpretability and predictive performance

Questions

- What does generateDesign could only produce 138 points instead of 1000?
- Is there a better way for conditional subsetting of Params?
- How to combine interpretability measure into one measure?
- How to get interaction measure more stable?
